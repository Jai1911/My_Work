This project is a basic quiz bot, that allows the user to enter any genric question in the interface and upon clicking search, the answer is displayed.
The interface is built using a GUI 'Tkinter' and a search box and search button were added on to that. For getting the answer, I have used OpenAI's api key which is free to create and use to some extent.
Although the code runs without any errors, the answer that is displayed isn't always correct. But this has somethin to do with the OpenAI's api and the model that is used for finding the answer.
